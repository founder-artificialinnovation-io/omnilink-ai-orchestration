I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out because of Techstars' exceptional track record in supporting innovative AI companies.

I'm {{founderName}}, founder of OmniLink - a multi-modal AI orchestration platform that's solving a critical infrastructure problem for AI-driven businesses.

**The Problem**: Companies using multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Claude, Cohere, etc.) struggle with:
- Complex integration management
- Inconsistent performance monitoring  
- Workflow orchestration across providers
- Cost optimization challenges

**Our Solution**: OmniLink provides a unified platform that:
âœ… Orchestrates tasks across multiple AI providers
âœ… Optimizes cost and performance automatically
âœ… Provides real-time monitoring and analytics
âœ… Enables complex multi-step AI workflows

**Traction**: 
- Built MVP with working demo
- Identified $2.1B+ TAM in AI infrastructure
- Strong technical foundation ready for scale

**The Ask**: We're raising ${{fundingAmount}} to accelerate development and capture this rapidly growing market. Given Techstars' expertise in AI infrastructure companies, I'd love to discuss how OmniLink fits your investment thesis.

Would you be available for a 15-minute call next week to see our demo?

Best regards,

            subject: "YC Alumni: OmniLink Demo - Multi-Modal AI Orchestration",
            template: `Hi {{firstName}},

As fellow builders in the YC ecosystem, I wanted to share something that could be game-changing for AI infrastructure.

I'm {{founderName}}, and I've built OmniLink - think "Zapier for AI providers" but with enterprise-grade orchestration.

**Why now?** 
- 73% of companies use 3+ AI providers
- $2.1B market growing 40% annually  
- No unified orchestration solution exists

**What we've built**:
ðŸš€ Live platform orchestrating OpenAI, Claude, Cohere
ðŸ“Š Real-time cost/performance optimization
ðŸ”§ Visual workflow builder for complex AI tasks
âš¡ 10x faster deployment vs custom integrations

**YC Connection**: This solves the exact problem many YC AI companies face - we could be the infrastructure layer for the next wave of YC AI startups.

**Demo**: {{demoUrl}} (2-minute setup, see it working immediately)

Raising ${{fundingAmount}} - would love 10 minutes to show you what we've built.

Best,

I'm reaching out because of your focus on AI infrastructure investments.

**Quick Context**: I'm {{founderName}}, founder of OmniLink - we're building the orchestration layer that every AI company will need as they scale.

**The Market Reality**:
- Companies average 4.2 AI providers (our research)

- $2.1B+ TAM growing 40% annually

**Our Approach**:
Instead of another AI model, we built the infrastructure:
âœ… Multi-provider orchestration (OpenAI, Claude, Cohere, etc.)
âœ… Intelligent routing and failover
âœ… Cost optimization algorithms  
âœ… Enterprise security and monitoring

**Traction Highlights**:
- Working platform with live demo
- Strong technical moat in orchestration algorithms
- Clear path to $10M+ ARR

**The Investment**: ${{fundingAmount}} to capture this rapidly expanding market.

**Next Step**: 15-minute demo call? I can show you the platform working in real-time.
